  <h1>About Rana Driving School</h1>
  <p><strong>Experience You Can Trust — Progress You Can Feel</strong></p>

  <p>
    At <strong>Rana Driving School</strong>, we bring over two decades of hands-on driving instruction backed by deep local knowledge and a commitment to real results.
  </p>

  <p>
    The school was founded by <strong>Mr. Rana</strong>, who’s been teaching learners for over <strong>22 years</strong>, building a reputation for calm, effective, and adaptable instruction. In 2021, I officially joined the business after learning the ropes alongside my studies. I now hold a <strong>First Class Honours degree</strong>, and I’m combining my technical background with driving education to modernise how we teach and operate.
  </p>

  <p>
    From day one, our focus has been simple: help learners become <strong>safe, confident, and independent drivers</strong> — whether you're just starting out or switching to automatic. Our teaching methods are structured, DVSA-compliant, and tailored to individual needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    We cover all major test centres in the region and offer flexible lesson times, mock tests, progress tracking, and practical feedback after every session.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Over <strong>25 years combined experience</strong></li>
    <li>Manual and automatic instructors</li>
    <li>Flexible pick-up and drop-off</li>
    <li>Patient, multilingual, DVSA-approved trainers</li>
    <li>Local route knowledge that gives you the edge</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Whether you’re starting from zero or returning after a break, <strong>Rana Driving School</strong> will get you test-ready — and road-ready.
